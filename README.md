# slack-ordle-bot
Slack bot for tracking scores of -ordle games.<br>
Supported games are
- Wordle
- Worldle
- Quordle
- Countryle
- Dumble

## Setup
1. Create a new Slack app
2. Create a bot user in **OAuth and Permissions** and enable `chat:write`, `commands` scopes.
3. Create 2 slash commands corresponding to the `ordle-stat` and `ordle-top` functions.
4. Host the functions with [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/).
5. Connect the slash commands to the hosted functions.
6. Enable **Event Subscriptions** and set the Request URL to the url for the `ordle-add` function.
7. Subscribe the bot to `message.channels`, `message.im`.
9. Create a [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) database, create a new web app, and set each attribute of the [config object](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object) as an environment variable.
10. Add your Slack app signing secret as an environment variable.

## Slash Commands
For this section, the Slack slash command for `orlde-stat` will be `/oadd` and `ordle-top` will be `/otop`, and so on.

### `/ostat`
Displays lifetime and monthly statistics for the user.

### `/otop <game> <num=5>`
Displays the top `<num>` players and their scores for `<game>`.<br>
If no value for `<num>` is provided, a default value of `5` is used.

### `/otop-monthly <game>`
Displays the monthly winners from the paste year for `<game>`.

## Adding New Games
To add support for new games, you'll need to make a function that parses out the sharing text into the day of the game and a score. This function can live in `game_parsers.js`. You'll also need to add/update some meta-info about the game in `GAME_INFO`.
